## 3. User Pain Points & Goals
([back to product profile](product-profile.md))

### User Pain Points:

1. **Cognitive Overload:**
   - Information overload leads to mental fatigue and reduced problem-solving effectiveness
   - Difficulty filtering relevant from irrelevant information in data-heavy scenarios

2. **Tracking and Documentation Challenges:**
   - Difficulty documenting thought processes in a way that's transparent and reviewable
   - Struggle to communicate reasoning steps to team members or stakeholders
   - Lost context when returning to complex problems after time away
   - Difficult to find similar examples of system specifications, customer configurations or codebase solutions. Only asking for help from different colleagues helps, but they are not always available. Research process is time consuming.

3. **Information Fragmentation:**
   - Users struggle to maintain context across multiple information sources related to current list of projects
   - Documentation scattered across different platforms (Notion, Google Drive, Jira)
   - Mental effort required to synthesize related information from disparate systems

4. **Context Switching Burden:**
   - Constantly distracted by jumping from one project topic to a different project topic
   - Productivity loss and mental fatigue from frequent task switching
   - Difficulty maintaining deep focus on complex problems

5. **Process Inefficiency:**
   - All processes are manual with numerous checkboxes to check
   - Lack of automation creates tedious workflow and introduces human error
   - Time wasted on repetitive tasks that could be systematized

### User Goals:

1. **Streamlined Information Management:**
   - Access consolidated information from multiple sources in a single interface
   - Reduce mental effort required to synthesize related information from disparate systems
   - Maintain clear context when working across different projects and information sources

2. **Knowledge Discovery & Reuse:**
   - Easily find relevant examples of system specifications, configurations, and code solutions
   - Reduce time spent researching by surfacing similar past work automatically

3. **Focus & Context Preservation:**
   - Maintain deep focus without disruptive context switching
   - Seamlessly transition between related tasks within the same project
   - Preserve mental context when returning to projects after interruptions

4. **Process Automation:**
   - Reduce manual checkboxes and repetitive tasks through intelligent automation
   - Minimize human error in routine processes
   - Free up mental bandwidth for high-value complex problem-solving

5. **Enhanced Collaboration:**
   - Document thought processes transparently for team reference
   - Communicate reasoning and decisions clearly to stakeholders
   - Facilitate asynchronous collaboration without constant meetings
