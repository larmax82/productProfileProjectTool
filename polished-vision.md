# Idea: Unified Tool with AI capabilites for PMs and TPMs in Professional Services

While exploring various ways to implement several OKR ideas and integrate AI into the daily workflow, I observed that most of the tools currently used by PM and TPM are web-based, including Jira for project and task management, Google Drive for storing project-related files, Google Docs for system creation, Google Sheets for effort estimation, and Notion as the main documentation base. Additionally, all users utilize Google Chrome as their primary browser.

This led me to the idea of creating "SideSlide." SideSlide is a Chrome extension that adds a customizable sliding panel to any webpage. The panel slides in from the right side of the screen when users click the extension icon or use a key combination, providing a consistent interface across all websites. This extension addresses the problem of context switching between tabs by offering users additional workspace without disrupting their browsing experience.

This document describes initial set of ideas, features that could be included in the product as well as the chain of thoughts describing persona and daily challenges persona faces.


## Product Vision

SideSlide transforms how Professional Services teams manage projects by creating a cohesive experience that eliminates information fragmentation, preserves critical context, automates repetitive tasks, and builds institutional knowledge. By reducing cognitive load and administrative burden, we enable teams to deliver projects with unprecedented efficiency—reducing context switching by 40% and information retrieval time by 50%.



## Key Differentiators

SideSlide addresses four fundamental challenges faced by Professional Services organizations:

**Information Consolidation:** SideSlide creates a single source of truth by integrating data from multiple platforms (Jira, Notion, Google Workspace), eliminating the time and mental effort spent navigating between disparate systems.

**Knowledge Repository:** Our Memory Bank captures technical specifications, configuration settings, and proven solutions, creating an institutional knowledge base that grows more valuable with each completed project and remains accessible for future reference.

**Intelligent Automation:** By streamlining repetitive workflows and administrative tasks, SideSlide minimizes opportunities for human error while freeing your team to focus on complex problem-solving and customer relationships.

**UI 

SideSlide isn't just another tool in your workflow—it's the workspace that brings everything together, empowering your team to deliver projects with unprecedented efficiency and quality.
