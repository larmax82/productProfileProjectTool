# Net Promoter Score (NPS) Explanation

## What is Net Promoter Score?
Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a widely used customer experience metric that measures user loyalty and satisfaction. It's based on a single question:

"On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend our product to a friend or colleague?"

## How NPS Works
Respondents are grouped into three categories based on their ratings:

- **Promoters (score 9-10)**: Loyal enthusiasts who will keep using the product and refer others
- **Passives (score 7-8)**: Satisfied but unenthusiastic users who are vulnerable to competitive offerings
- **Detractors (score 0-6)**: Unhappy users who can damage your brand through negative word-of-mouth

## Calculating NPS
The NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters:

NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors

The score ranges from -100 (if every user is a Detractor) to +100 (if every user is a Promoter).

## Interpreting NPS
- **< 0**: Needs significant improvement
- **0-30**: Good but has room for improvement
- **30-70**: Great, indicates strong customer satisfaction
- **70+**: Excellent, world-class customer loyalty and satisfaction

## NPS for B2B Software Tools
For B2B software tools, an NPS of 40+ is considered excellent. This indicates that a significant majority of your users are enthusiastic about the product and would recommend it to others.

## Benefits of Using NPS
- Simple to implement and understand
- Provides a standardized benchmark for comparison
- Correlates with business growth
- Identifies areas for improvement by following up with detractors
- Highlights loyal customers who can become advocates

## Best Practices for NPS Implementation
1. Survey users regularly, but not excessively (quarterly or bi-annually)
2. Follow up with open-ended questions to understand the reasoning behind scores
3. Share results across the organization
4. Set specific improvement targets
5. Take action on the feedback received
6. Close the feedback loop by communicating changes made based on feedback
