# Productivity Metrics Explanation

This document explains the calculation and significance of two key productivity metrics for our project management tool.

## Context Switching Reduction (40% decrease)

This metric measures how much time team members save by avoiding constant switching between different applications and tools.

### Current Situation
Currently, PMs and TPMs switch between:
- Jira for task tracking
- Notion for documentation
- Gmail and Google Chat for communication
- Spreadsheets for estimations
- Custom internal tools for specific processes

Each switch requires mental adjustment and reorientation, adding cognitive overhead to the workday.

### Calculation (Based on 1 hour baseline)
- **Baseline**: 1 hour per day spent switching between tools
- **Target Reduction**: 40%
- **Time Saved Per Person**: 24 minutes per day
- **Weekly Savings**: 2 hours per person
- **Monthly Savings**: 8 hours per person
- **Organization-wide Impact**: ~800 hours saved monthly (across 100 PMs & TPMs)

### Measurement Methods
- Time tracking software
- User activity monitoring
- Self-reported time usage surveys (before and after implementation)
- Tool transition frequency metrics

## Information Retrieval Efficiency (50% reduction)

This metric addresses the pain point of difficult and time-consuming information searches.

### Current Situation
Team members currently face:
- Documentation scattered across different platforms
- Difficulty finding similar examples of system specifications and configurations
- Time-consuming research processes
- Dependency on colleagues for finding information, who aren't always available

### Calculation (Based on 1 hour baseline)
- **Baseline**: 1 hour per day spent searching for information
- **Target Reduction**: 50%
- **Time Saved Per Person**: 30 minutes per day
- **Weekly Savings**: 2.5 hours per person
- **Monthly Savings**: 10 hours per person
- **Organization-wide Impact**: ~1,000 hours saved monthly (across 100 PMs & TPMs)

### Achievement Strategies
- Centralized knowledge repository with effective search capabilities
- AI-powered suggestion systems that surface relevant information proactively
- Tagging and categorization of past solutions and specifications
- Analytics to identify frequently accessed information and make it more prominent

### Measurement Methods
- Search logs (time between query and useful result selection)
- User surveys about information accessibility
- Tracking frequency of colleague assistance requests
- Knowledge base utilization metrics

## Business Impact

These productivity improvements translate to significant business benefits:
- **Increased capacity**: ~1,800 combined hours monthly can be redirected to value-adding work
- **Improved focus**: Fewer interruptions lead to higher quality outputs
- **Enhanced job satisfaction**: Reducing frustrating administrative overhead
- **Accelerated project delivery**: More time for actual project tasks means faster completion
- **Knowledge democratization**: Reduced dependency on specific individuals for information

## ROI Calculation

With an average fully-loaded cost of $60/hour for PMs and TPMs:
- 1,800 hours saved monthly Ã— $60 = $108,000 monthly productivity value
- $1,296,000 annual productivity improvement
